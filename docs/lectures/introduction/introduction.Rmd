# Why all the talk about reproducible research?

<br>

The *Reproducibility project* set out to replicate 100 experiments published in
high-impact psychology journals.<sup>1</sup>

About one-half to two-thirds of the original findings could not be observed in
the replication study.

Medicine is among the most affected research fields. A study in Nature found
that 47 out of 53 medical research papers focused on cancer research were
irreproducible.<sup>3</sup>

<br>
Common features were failure to show all the data and inappropriate use of
statistical tests.

# Reproducibility is rarer than you think

There are many so-called excuses not to work reproducibly:

> “Thank you for your interest in our paper. For the [redacted] calculations I
> used my own code, and there is no public version of this code, which could be
> downloaded. Since this code is not very user-friendly and is under constant
> development I prefer not to share this code.”

> “We do not typically share our internal data or code with people outside our
> collaboration.”

> “When you approach a PI for the source codes and raw data, you better explain
> who you are, whom you work for, why you need the data and what you are going
> to do with it.”

> “I have to say that this is a very unusual request without any explanation!
> Please ask your supervisor to send me an email with a detailed, and I mean
> detailed, explanation.”

# "What's in it for me?"

## .green[Before] the project
* Improved structure and organization
* Forced to think about scope and limitations

--

## .green[During] the project
* Easier to re-run analyses and generate results after updating data, tools,
  parameters, *etc.*
* Closer interaction between collaborators
* Much of the manuscript "writes itself"

--

## .green[After] the project
* Faster resumption of research by others (or, more likely, your future self),
  thereby increasing the impact of your work
* Increased visibility in the scientific community
