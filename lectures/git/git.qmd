## What is Git?

::: {.incremental}
- A widely used system for distributed [version control]{.green}
- Keeps a [complete history]{.green} of the changes you make to your files
- Each point in the history can be re-visited and compared with others
- Git tracks [who contributed what]{.green} to your code
- Git can help you [version, backup and share]{.green} your code and documents
- Kind of like Dropbox, but you decide when each version is saved (plus a lot
  of more advanced features)
- Git is mainly used for [text files]{.green}, not large or binary files
:::

## Git nomenclature

::: {.incremental}
- A [repository]{.green} is a collection that encompasses all the files and
  directories of a project
- A [commit]{.green} is a snapshot of a repository's history, *i.e.* a point
  in development time
- Development can be separated into [branches]{.green}, allowing for concurrent
  work on the same repository with simple transitions between functional and
  work-in-progress code
- Uploading changes to a remote repository is called [pushing]{.green}, while
  downloading changes is called [pulling]{.green}

## Tracking code in three steps

![](../../../pages/images/git_overview_local.png){height=300 fig-align=center}

::: {.incremental}
1. Do some [coding]{.green} (*i.e.* make or change contents of files)
2. [Stage]{.green} the changes (*i.e.* specify which changes should be stored)
3. [Commit]{.green} the changes (storing them in the repository's history)
:::

## Git is highly versatile

::: {.incremental}
- Ensures [reproducibility]{.green} of your analyses, regardless of whether youâ€™ve
  made additional changes to your code after the analysis is run
- Easily [fix mistakes]{.green} by reverting files to previous versions
- Improves your coding by giving you [additional structure]{.green}
- Your code has a [backup]{.green} in your remote repository
- Easily [share your code]{.green} and collaborate with your colleagues
