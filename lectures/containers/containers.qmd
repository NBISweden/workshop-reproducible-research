## What is [Docker]{.green}?

::: {.incremental}
- Standardized packaging for software, dependencies as well as the operating
  system
- Docker lets you create and run applications securely isolated in
  [containers]{.green}
:::

## Docker in life science

Docker can also be used to define software environments and settings for
benchmarking studies:

<br>

[CAMI Challenge](https://data.cami-challenge.org/): an independent evaluation of
several tools in the field of metagenomics.

> [...] We defined standards for submitting the software itself, along with
> parameter settings and required databases and implemented them in Docker
> container templates ... ^[_Sczyrba et al Nature Methods (2017) 14:1063â€“1071,
> [doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4458](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4458)_]

## Docker in life science

Docker can also be used to define software environments and settings for
benchmarking studies:

<br>

[2nd CAMI Challenge](https://www.microbiome-cosi.org/cami/cami/cami2)

> For reproducibility, participants could submit a Docker container containing
> the complete workflow, a Bioconda script or a software repository with
> detailed installation instructions [...] ^[_Meyer et al Nature Methods (2022)
> 19:429-440, [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-022-01431-4](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-022-01431-4)_]

## Docker nomenclature

::: {.fragment}
![](images/images_and_containers.png){height=350 fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.incremental}
- A Docker [image]{.green} is a stand-alone executable package of software
- A Docker [container]{.green} is an instance of a Docker image
- A [Dockerfile]{.green} is a recipe used to build a Docker image
- [Docker Hub]{.green} is an online service for hosting Docker images
:::

## An example: using a different OS

::: {.fragment}
Check OS on local machine
```{.bash code-line-numbers="|1|2"}
$ uname -a
Darwin johnsmbp.local 19.6.0 Darwin Kernel Version 19.6.0: [...] x86_64
```
:::

::: {.fragment}
Pull Ubuntu (Linux) image
```{.bash code-line-numbers="|1|2-6"}
$ docker pull ubuntu:16.04
16.04: Pulling from library/ubuntu
22dc81ace0ea: Pull complete
...
Digest: sha256:e348fbbea0e0a0e73ab0370de151e7800684445c509d46195aef73e090a49bd6
Status: Downloaded image for ubuntu:16.04
```

## An example: using a different OS

Check OS on local machine
```{.bash}
$ uname -a
Darwin johnsmbp.local 19.6.0 Darwin Kernel Version 19.6.0: [...] x86_64
```

Run the container interactively and check OS version
```{.bash code-line-numbers="|1|2|3"}
$ docker run -it ubuntu:16.04
root@407b0fd13fe5:/## uname -a
Linux 407b0fd13fe5 4.9.60-linuxkit-aufs [...] x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

## Mounting volumes

Local `project/` directory:

Docker container file system:

## What can I use Docker for?

::: {.incremental}
1. As an advanced [environment]{.green} manager
2. To package your [code]{.green} together with the environment it needs
3. To package a [whole project]{.green} with environment, code _and_ data
:::

<br>

::: {.fragment}
Alternatives (2) and (3) are generally not advisable; containers are best used
to [control the environment]{.green} for maximal reproducibility, portability
and ease-of-use.
:::

<br>

::: {.fragment}
The best overall solution is a Git repository storing documentation, code,
environment specification as well as instructions on how to get the raw data.

## What is Apptainer?

![](http://apptainer.org/static/hero-img-e614806cf573fd0cbbe09a25d9e69637.png){fig-align=center}

::: {.incremental}
- Another software for working with containers, similar to Docker
- An apptainer image is contained in a single file, facilitating portability
- Does not require `root` access, making it suitable for work at HPCs
:::

## What is Apptainer?

![](http://apptainer.org/static/hero-img-e614806cf573fd0cbbe09a25d9e69637.png){fig-align=center}

::: {.incremental}
- Apptainer used to be 'Singularity'.
- In 2021 Singularity joined the Linux Foundation and became
  [Apptainer]{.green}.
- The company [Sylabs]{.green} still maintains Singularity as a commercial
piece of software.
- [SingularityCE]{.green} is an Open Source project supported by Sylabs.
- The three versions are similar today, but will diverge with time.
- [Apptainer]{.green} is the most commonly adopted version of the scientific
  community.
