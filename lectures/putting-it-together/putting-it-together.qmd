## Take control of your research by making its different components reproducible

## What have we learned?

![](../../pages/images/reproducibility_overview_with_logos.png){height=300 fig-align=center}

- How to use the version control system [Git]{.green} to track changes to code
- How to use the package and environment manager [Conda]{.green}
- How to use the workflow managers [Snakemake]{.green} and [Nextflow]{.green}
- How to use [Quarto]{.green} and [Jupyter]{.green} to generate automated
  reports and to document your analyses
- How to use [Docker]{.green} and [Apptainer]{.green} to distribute
  containerized computational environments
- How to create and maintain proper [documentation]{.green}

## Divide your work into distinct projects

::: {.incremental}
- Keep all [files]{.green} needed to go from raw data to final results in a
  dedicated directory
- Use relevant [subdirectories]{.green}
- Use [Git]{.green} to version control your projects
- Do not store data and results/output in your Git repository
- When in doubt, [commit often]{.green} rather than not
:::

## Find your own project structure

For example:
```bash
code/          Code needed to go from input files to final results
data/          Raw data - this should never edited
doc/           Documentation of the project
env/           Environment-related files, e.g. Conda environments or Dockerfiles
results/       Output from workflows and analyses
README.md      Project documentation
```

- [https://github.com/fasterius/nbis-support-template]()
- [https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/snakemake-workflow-template]()

## Treasure your data

::: {.incremental}
- Keep your raw data [read-only]{.green} and static
- Don't create different versions of the input data - write a [script]{.green},
  [Quarto]{.green} document, [Jupyter]{.green} notebook or a [Snakemake]{.green}
  / [Nextflow]{.green} workflow if you need to pre-process your input data so that
  the steps can be recreated
- [Backup]{.green}! Keep redundant copies in different physical locations
- Upload your raw data as soon as possible to a [public data repository]{.green}
:::

## Organise your coding

::: {.incremental}
- Avoid generating files [interactively]{.green} or doing things [by
  hand]{.green}
- Write [scripts]{.green}, [Quarto]{.green} documents, [Jupyter]{.green}
  notebooks or [Snakemake]{.green} / [Nextflow]{.green} workflows for
  reproducible results to connect raw data to final results
- Keep the [parameters]{.green} separate (_e.g._ at top of file or in a separate
  configuration file)

## What is reasonable for your project?

<br>

![](../../pages/images/reproducibility_overview_with_logos.png){height=450 fig-align=center}

## What is reasonable for your project?

[Minimal]{.green}

_Write code in a reproducible way and track your environment_

- Track your projects with a [Git]{.green} repository each; publish code with
  your results on _e.g._ [GitHub](https://github.com)
- Use [Conda]{.green} to install software in environments that can be exported
  and installed on a different system
- Publish your `environment.yml` file along with your code

## What is reasonable for your project?

[Good]{.green}

_Structure and document your code with notebooks_

- Use [Quarto]{.green} or [Jupyter]{.green} notebooks to better keep track of
  and document your code
- Track your notebooks with Git

## What is reasonable for your project?

[Great]{.green}

_Track the **full** environment and connect your code in a workflow_

- Go one step beyond in tracking your environment using [Docker]{.green} or
  [Apptainer]{.green}
- Convert your code into a [Snakemake]{.green} / [Nextflow]{.green} workflow
- Track both your image definitions (_e.g._ Dockerfiles) as well as your
  workflows with Git

## Alternatives

[Version control]{.green}

- **Git** – Widely used and a lot of tools available + GitHub/BitBucket.
- **Jujutsu** - New "front-end" for Git by Google, with a smaller and improved
  mental model for version control.
- **Mercurial** – Distributed model just like Git, close to Sourceforge.
- **Subversion** – Centralized model unlike git/mercurial; no local repository
  on your computer and somewhat easier to use.

## Alternatives

[Environment / package managers]{.green}

- **Conda** – General purpose environment and package manager. Community-hosted
  collections of tools at Bioconda or Conda-forge.
- **Pixi** - General purpose environment/package manager built on the Conda
  ecosystem, but much faster and works seamlessly with lock-files.
- **Pip** – Package manager for Python, has a large repository at PyPI.
- **Apt/yum/brew** – Native package managers for different OS. Integrated in OS
  and might deal with _e.g._ update notifications better.
- **Virtualenv** – Environment manager used to set up semi-isolated python
  environments.

## Alternatives

[Workflow managers]{.green}

- **Snakemake** – Based on Python, easily understandable format, relies on file
  names.
- **Nextflow** – Based on Groovy, uses data pipes rather than file names to
  construct the workflow.
- **Make** – Used in software development and has been around since the 70s.
  Flexible but notoriously obscure syntax.
- **Galaxy** -  attempts to make computational biology accessible to researchers
  without programming experience by using a GUI.

## Alternatives

[Literate programming]{.green}

- **Quarto** - Developed by Posit (previously RStudio), command-line tool
  focused on generating high-quality documents in a language-agnostic way.
- **Jupyter** – Create and share notebooks in a variety of languages and formats
  by using a web browser.
- **R Markdown** – Developed by Posit (previously RStudio), focused on
  generating high-quality documents.
- **Zeppelin** – Developed by Apache. Closely integrated with Spark for
  distributed computing and Big Data applications.
- **Beaker** – Newcomer based on IPython, just as Jupyter. Has a focus on
  integrating multiple languages in the same notebook.

## Alternatives

[Containerization / virtualization]{.green}

- **Docker** – Used for packaging and isolating applications in containers.
  Dockerhub allows for convenient sharing. Requires root access.
- **Apptainer/Singularity** – Simpler Docker alternative geared towards high
  performance computing. Does not require root.
- **Podman** - open source daemonless container tool similar to docker in many
  regards
- **Shifter** – Similar ambition as Singularity, but less focus on mobility and
  more on resource management.
- **VirtualBox/VMWare** – Virtualisation rather than containerization. Less
  lightweight, but no reliance on host kernel.
