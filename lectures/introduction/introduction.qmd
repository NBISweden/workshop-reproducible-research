## Why all the talk about reproducibility?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
In 2015 the _Open Science Collaboration_ set out to replicate 100 experiments
published in high-impact psychology journals. ^[*"Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science". Science349, aac4716 (2015)*]

<br>

::: {.small}
- Less than 50% of the experiments could be replicated
- Effect sizes were significantly smaller in the replicated studies

The same year, money spent on preclinical research that could not be reproduced
was estimated at $28 billion in the US. ^[*"The Economics of Reproducibility in Preclinical Research". PLOS Biology 16(4): e1002626 (2015)*]

In 2016, 1,576 scientists were surveyed about reproducibility. ^[*"1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility". Nature 533: 452–454 (2016)*]

- 90% agreed that there is a 'slight' or 'significant' reproducibility crisis

In 2018, Stodden _et al_ estimated the reproducibility rate of computational
papers published in the journal _Science_. ^[*An empirical analysis of journal policy effectiveness for computational reproducibility, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 115 (11) 2584-2589 (2018)*]

::: {.small}
- Only 26% of the studies were estimated to be reproducible
- Failure to reproduce was mainly due to lack of data and code
- Stricter journal guidelines gave improvement but were insufficient

## Reproducibility in computational research

More examples:

:::{.fragment}
- Trisovic _et al_ (2022) found that only 26% of R files in the Harvard
  Dataverse could be executed as-is.^[*A large-scale study on research code quality and execution. Scientific Data 9.1 (2022): 60.*]
:::

:::{.fragment}
- Sheeba & Mietchen (2024) found that only 8% of Jupyter notebooks used in
  publications executed without errors.^[*Computational reproducibility of Jupyter notebooks from biomedical publications. GigaScience 13 (2024): giad113.*]

- Missing dependencies
- Missing variables

## How are you handling your [data]{.green}?

::: {.fragment}
[Decent:]{.light-grey}

- Data available on request
- All metadata required for generating the results available
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Good:]{.light-grey}

- Raw data deposited in public repositories
- If the raw data needed preprocessing, scripts were used rather than modifying
  it manually
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Great:]{.light-grey}

- Section in the paper or online repository (_e.g._ GitHub) to aid in
  reproduction
- Used non-proprietary and machine-readable formats, *e.g.* `.csv` rather than
  `.xls`.

*If you want to learn more about data management in-depth, NBIS has a course for
you: [Introduction to Data Management Practices]{.green}*
:::

## How are you handling your [code]{.green}?

::: {.fragment}
[Decent:]{.light-grey}

- All code for generating results from processed data available on request
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Good:]{.light-grey}

- All code for generating results from raw data is available
- The code is publicly available with timestamps or tags
:::


::: {.fragment}
[Great:]{.light-grey}

- Code is documented and contains instructions for reproducing results
- Seeds were used and documented for heuristic methods
:::

## How are you handling your [environment]{.green}?

::: {.fragment}
[Decent:]{.light-grey}

- Key programs used are mentioned in the _materials and methods_ section
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Good:]{.light-grey}

- List of all programs used and their respective versions are available
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Great:]{.light-grey}

- Instructions for reproducing the whole environment publicly available
:::

## "What's in it for me?"

::: {.fragment}
[Before]{.green} the project:

- Improved structure and organisation
- Forced to think about scope and limitations
:::

::: {.fragment}
[During]{.green} the project:

- Easier to re-run analyses and generate results after updates and/or changes
- Closer interaction between collaborators
- Much of the manuscript "writes itself"
:::


::: {.fragment}
[After]{.green} the project:

- Faster resumption of research by others (or, more likely, your future self)
- Increased visibility in the scientific community
