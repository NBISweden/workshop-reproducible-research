This is to certify that **`r params$participant`** has successfully taken part in the NBIS/ELIXIR course 

**Tools for Reproducible Research**
 
The course was held `r params$location`, `r params$month_start` `r params$day_start` - `r params$month_end` `r params$day_end` `r params$year`. It consisted of lectures, computer exercises and group discussions.

The following subjects and fields were covered:

- Use good practices for data analysis and management
- Clearly organise their bioinformatic projects
- Use the version control system Git to track and collaborate on code
- Use the package and environment manager Conda
- Use and develop workflows with Snakemake and Nextflow
- Use Quarto and Jupyter Notebooks to document and generate automated reports
- Use Docker and Singularity/Apptainer to distribute containerized computational environments
 
**Examination**: Presence during all the lectures and computer/practical exercises.


The course was arranged by the National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden (NBIS), Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab) and ELIXIR-Europe.
