## Introduction

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create
and share documents that contain code, equations, visualizations and text. The
functionality is partly overlapping with Quarto (see the
[tutorial](quarto.html)), in that they both use markdown and code chunks to
generate reports that integrate results of computations with the code that
generated them. Jupyter Notebook comes from the Python community while Quarto
was developed by Posit (who also created R Markdown and RStudio), but you could
use most common programming languages in either alternative. In practice though,
it's quite common that R developers use Jupyter but probably not very common
that Python developers use RStudio. Some reasons to use Jupyter include:

- Python is lacking a really good IDE for doing exploratory scientific data
  analysis, like RStudio or Matlab. Some people use Jupyter simply as an
  alternative for that.
- The Jupyter Project community is large and dynamic, and there are
  lots of tools for sharing, displaying or interacting with notebooks.
- An early ambition with Jupyter notebooks (and its predecessor IPython
  notebooks) was to be analogous to the lab notebook used in a wet lab. It
  would allow the data scientist to document his or her day-to-day work and
  interweave results, ideas, and hypotheses with the code. From
  a reproducibility perspective, this is one of the main advantages.
- Jupyter notebooks can be used, just like Quarto, to provide a tighter
  connection between your data and your results by integrating results of
  computations with the code that generated them. They can also do this in an
  interactive way that makes them very appealing for sharing with others.

As always, the best way is to try it out yourself and decide what to use it
for!

This tutorial depends on files from the course GitHub repo. Take a look at the
[setup](../home_precourse.html) for instructions on how to set it up if you
haven't done so already. Then open up a terminal and go to
`workshop-reproducible-research/tutorials/jupyter` and activate your
`jupyter-env` Conda environment.

## The basics

One thing that sets Jupyter Notebook apart from what you might be used to is
that it's a web application, _i.e._ you edit and run your code from your
browser. But first you have to start the Jupyter Notebook server. At this
point you may either try the classic notebook interface by running:

```bash
jupyter notebook --allow-root
```

Or give the more feature-rich Jupyter lab interface a try by running:

```bash
jupyter lab --allow-root
```

Whichever interface you choose you should see something similar to this
printed to your terminal:

```no-highlight
[I 18:02:26.722 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /Users/john/workshop-reproducible-research/tutorials/jupyter
[I 18:02:26.723 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels
[I 18:02:26.723 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
[I 18:02:26.723 NotebookApp] http://localhost:8888/?token=e03f10ccb40efc3c6154358593c410a139b76acf2cae000
[I 18:02:26.723 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
[C 18:02:26.724 NotebookApp]

    Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
    to login with a token:
        http://localhost:8888/?token=e03f10ccb40efc3c6154358593c410a139b76acf2cae785c
[I 18:02:27.209 NotebookApp] Accepting one-time-token-authenticated connection from ::1
```

::: {.callout-tip title="A note for Windows users"}
If you see the error message `Start : This command cannot be run due to the
error: The system cannot find the file specified. ...` then try starting
Jupyter with `jupyter notebook --no-browser` then copy the URL given into the
browser directly.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Jupyter notebook versions"}
Depending on what version of the `notebook` conda package you have installed,
the interface may look slightly different. The screenshots in this tutorial
are from version 7, an update which has brought the 'classic' Jupyter notebook
closer to the Jupyter lab interface. Read more about this update at the
[Jupyter homepage](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migrate_to_notebook7.html).
:::

The Jupyter Notebook/Lab interface probably opened up a web browser for you
automatically, otherwise go to the address specified in the message in the
terminal. Note that the server is running locally (as
`http://localhost:8888`) so this does not require that you have an active
internet connection. Also note that it says:

```no-highlight
Serving notebooks from local directory: </some/local/path/workshop-reproducible-research/tutorials/jupyter>
```

Everything you do in your Notebook session will be stored in this directory, so
you won't lose any work if you shut down the server.

> ![](images/jupyter_dashboard.png){ width=700px }

What you're looking at is the Notebook dashboard. This is where you manage your
files, notebooks, and kernels. The Files tab shows the files in your directory.
The Running tab keeps track of all your processes.

The Jupyter lab dashboard should look something like this:

> ![](images/jupyterlab_dashboard.png){ width=700px }

Let's start by creating an empty notebook. You can do this by selecting the
Files tab and clicking New > Notebook. When the notebook opens, select the
suggested Python 3 kernel from the drop-down menu.

This will open up a new tab or window looking like this:

> ![](images/jupyter_empty_nb.png){ width=700px }

Start by giving your notebook a name by clicking on the text "Untitled" at the
top of the page. Enter "jupyter-tutorial.ipynb".

Note that for most of this tutorial we will describe how you work in the actual
notebook and not devote a lot of time to the extra features available in the
Jupyter lab interface.

::: {.callout-tip}
If you want to start Jupyter Notebooks on a cluster that you SSH to (_e.g._
Uppmax) see the section in the [Extra material](#extra-material).
:::

Jupyter notebooks are made up of cells, and you are currently standing in
the first cell in your notebook. Your cursor should be blinking in this cell,
indicating that you are in "Edit mode" meaning that you can type text in the
cell. Pressing the `Esc` key puts you in "Command mode" which allows you to
manipulate the notebook as a whole, more on this later.

Cells in Jupyter notebooks can be of two types:*markdown* or *code*.

- **Markdown:**

These cells contain static material such as captions, text, lists, images and so
on. You express this using Markdown, which is a lightweight markup language.
Markdown documents can then be converted to other formats for viewing. The
format is discussed a little more in detail in the [Markdown
introduction](markdown.html). Jupyter Notebook uses a dialect of Markdown called
GitHub Flavoured Markdown, which is described [at
GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

- **Code:**

These are the cells that actually do something, just as code chunks do in
Quarto/R Markdown. You can write code in dozens of languages and do all
kinds of clever tricks. You then run the code cell and any output the code
generates, such as text or figures, will be displayed beneath the cell. We
will get back to this in much more detail, but for now it's enough to
understand that code cells are for executing code that is interpreted by a
kernel (in this case the Python version in your Conda environment).

Before we continue, here are some shortcuts that can be useful. Note that they
are only applicable when in "Command mode". Most of them are also available from
the menus. You can also view this list of shortcuts from the **Help** menu under
"Show Keyboard Shortcuts".

| Shortcut      |   Effect                                 |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| `enter`       | Enter Edit mode                          |
| `escape`      | Enter Command mode                       |
| `ctrl-enter`  | Run the cell                             |
| `shift-enter` | Run the cell and select the cell below   |
| `alt-enter`   | Run the cell and insert a new cell below |
| `s`           | Save the notebook                        |
| `tab`         | For code completion or indentation       |
| `m,y`         | Toggle between Markdown and Code cells   |
| `d-d`         | Delete a cell                            |
| `a`           | Insert cells above current cell          |
| `b`           | Insert cells below current cell          |
| `x`           | Cut currently selected cells             |
| `v`           | Paste cell below                         |
| `o`           | Toggle output of current cell            |

## Writing markdown

Let's use our first cell to create a header. Change the format from Code to
Markdown using the drop-down list in the Notebook Toolbar, or by pressing the
`m` key when in command mode. Double click on the cell, or hit `enter` to enter
editing mode and input "# My notebook" ("#" is used in Markdown for header 1).
Run the cell with `ctrl`-`enter` (`cmd`-`enter` on Mac).

Markdown is a simple way to structure your notebook into sections with
descriptive notes, lists, links, images etc.

Below are some examples of what you can do in markdown. Paste all or parts
of it into one or more cells in your notebook to see how it renders. Make
sure you set the cell type to Markdown.

```
## Introduction
In this notebook I will try out some of the **fantastic** concepts of Jupyter
Notebooks.

## Markdown basics
Examples of text attributes are:

- *italics*
- **bold**
- `monospace`

Sections can be separated by horizontal lines.

---

Blockquotes can be added, for instance to insert a Monty Python quote:

> Spam!
> Spam!
> Spam!
> Spam!

See [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html) for more information.
```

## Writing code

Now let's write some code! Since we chose a Python kernel, Python would be the
native language to run in a cell. Enter this code in the second cell and run
it:

```python
print("Hello world!")
```

Note how the output is directly displayed below the cell. This interactive way
of working is one of the things that sets Jupyter Notebook apart from RStudio
and Quarto. In RStudio/Quarto, documents are typically rendered top-to-bottom in
one run, while you work *in* a Jupyter notebook in a different way. This
requires some special attention when it comes to reproducibility, which we will
get back to in the [reproducibility](#reproducibility) section.

What **is** a Jupyter notebook? Let's look a closer at the notebook we're
currently working in. Jupyter Notebooks are autosaved every minute or so, so you
will already have it available. We can be a little meta and do this from within
the notebook itself, by running some shell commands in a code cell. This very
handy functionality is possible by prepending the command with `!`. Try adding
`!ls` to a code cell and run it. This will list the files in the current directory.

Aha, we have a new file called `jupyter-tutorial.ipynb`! This is our notebook.
Look at the first ten lines of the file by using `!head jupyter-tutorial.ipynb`.
Seems like it's just a plain old JSON file. Since it's a text file it's suitable
for version control with for example Git. There are however some special
considerations to take into account for Notebooks which we will cover in the
[reproducibility section](#reproducibility) of this tutorial.

Variables defined in cells become variables in the global namespace. You can
therefore share information between cells. Try to define a function or variable
in one cell and use it in the next. For example, add the following to a new cell
and run it:

```python
def print_me(str):
    print(str)
```

Now create a new cell and add:

```python
print_me("Hi!")
```

Your notebook should now look something like this.

> ![](images/jupyter_basic_update.png){ width=700px }

The focus of this tutorial is not on how to write Markdown or Python; you can
make really pretty notebooks with Markdown and you can code whatever you want
with Python. Rather, we will focus on the Jupyter Notebook features that allow
you to do a little more than that.

::: {.callout-note title="Quick recap"}
In this section we've learned:

- That a Jupyter notebook consists of a series of cells, and that they can
  be either markdown or code cells.
- That we execute the code in a code cell with the kernel that we chose
  when opening the notebook.
- We can run shell commands by prepending them with `!`.
- A Jupyter notebook is simply a text file in JSON format.
:::

## Magics

Magics constitute a simple command language that significantly extends the
power of Jupyter notebooks. There are two types of magics:

- **Line magics**: Commands that are prepended by `%`, and whose arguments only
  extend to the end of the line.
- **Cell magics**: Commands that start with `%%` and then apply to the whole
  cell. Must be written on the first line of a cell.

Now list all available magics with `%lsmagic` (which itself is a magic). You
add a question mark to a magic to show the help (_e.g._ `%lsmagic?`). Some of
them act as shortcuts for commonly used shell commands (`%ls`, `%cp`, `%cat`,
..). Others are useful for debugging and optimizing your code (`%timeit`,
`%debug`, `%prun`, ..). For more information see the
[magics documentation](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html).

A very useful magic, in particular when using shell commands a lot in your
work, is `%%capture`. This will capture the stdout/stderr of any code cell and
store them in a Python object. Run `%%capture?` to display the help and try to
understand how it works. Try it out with either some Python code, other magics
or shell commands. Here is an example of how you can make it work:

```no-highlight
%%capture output
%%bash
echo "Print to stdout"
echo "Print to stderr" >&2
```

... And in another cell:

```python
print("stdout:" + output.stdout)
print("stderr:" + output.stderr)
```

> **Tip** <br>
> You can capture the output of some magics directly like this: `my_dir = %pwd`.

The `%%script` magic is used for specifying a program (Bash, Perl, Ruby, ..)
with which to run the code (similar to a shebang). For some languages it's
possible to use these shortcuts:

- `%%ruby`
- `%%perl`
- `%%bash`
- `%%html`
- `%%latex`
- `%%R`

::: {.callout-note title="A note on R code"}
In order to use the `%%R` magic you need to install the `rpy2` extension, for
example with Conda. This package is already installed in the `jupyter-env`
environment you're using for this tutorial. However, you also have to load it
by running `%load_ext rpy2.ipython` in a cell.
:::

Try this out if you know any of the languages above. Otherwise you can always
try to print the quadratic formula with LaTeX!

```no-highlight
\begin{array}{*{20}c} {x = \frac{{ - b \pm \sqrt {b^2 - 4ac} }}{{2a}}} & {{\rm{when}}} & {ax^2 + bx + c = 0} \\ \end{array}
```

Another useful magic is `%precision` which sets the floating point precision
in the notebook. As a quick example, add the following to a cell and run it:

```python
float(100/3)
```

Next set the precision to 4 decimal points by running a cell with:

```
%precision 4
```

Now run the cell with `float(100/3)` again to see the difference.

Running `%precision` without additional arguments will restore the default.

magics

## Plotting

An essential feature of Jupyter Notebooks is of course the ability to visualize
data and results via plots. A full guide to plotting in Python is beyond the
scope of this course, but we'll offer a few glimpses into the plotting landscape
of Python.

First of all, Python has a library for plotting called
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html), which comes packed with
functionality for creating high-quality plots. Below is an example of how to
generate a line plot of a sine wave.

```python
# Import packages
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Generate a set of evenly spaced numbers between 0 and 100
x = np.linspace(0,3*np.pi,100)
# Use the sine function to generate y-values
y = np.sin(x)
# Plot the data
line, = plt.plot(x, y, color='red', linestyle="-")
```

By default plots are rendered in the notebook as rasterised images which can
make the quality poor. To render in scalable vector graphics format use the
`set_matplotlib_formats` from the matplotlib_inline package:

```python
import matplotlib_inline
matplotlib_inline.backend_inline.set_matplotlib_formats('pdf', 'svg')
```

Now try running the code for the sine wave plot again.

## Other packages for plotting

As we mentioned Matplotlib comes with **a lot** of functionality which is great
because it allows you to create all sorts of plots and modify them exactly to
your liking. However, this can also mean that creating very basic plots might
involve a lot of cumbersome coding, when all you want is a simple bar chart!

Fortunately there are a number of Python packages that build upon matplotlib but
with a much simplified interface. One such popular package is
[Seaborn](http://Seaborn.pydata.org/). Below we'll see how to generate a nice
looking bar plot with error bars.

First import the Seaborn package (using an abbreviated name to simplify typing):

```python
import seaborn as sns
```

Next we'll load some example data of penguins collected at the Palmer Station,
in Antarctica.

```python
penguins = sns.load_dataset("penguins")
# Look at first 5 lines of the data
penguins.head(5)
```

The most basic way to generate a bar plot of this data with Seaborn is:

```python
sns.barplot(data=penguins)
```

Simple right? Yes, but maybe not very informative. Here Seaborn simply
calculates the mean of all numeric variables for the penguins and plots them
with error bars representing a 95% confidence interval.

Let's say that instead we want to plot the mean value of the body mass of the
penguins at the different islands where they were examined.

```
sns.barplot(data=penguins, x="island", y="body_mass_g", errorbar="sd");
```

Here we specified to use values in the 'island' column as categories for the
x-axis, and values in the 'body_mass_g' column as values for the y-axis.
The barplot function of Seaborn will then calculate the mean body mass for each
island and plot the bars. With `errorbar="sd"` we tell the function to draw the
standard deviation as error bars, instead of computing a confidence interval.

If we instead want to visualize the data as a scatterplot we can use the
`sns.scatterplot` function. Let's plot the body mass vs bill length for all
penguins and colour the data points by species. We'll also move the legend
outside of the plotting area and modify the x and y-axis labels:

```python
# Store the matplotlib axes containing the plot in a variable called 'ax'
ax = sns.scatterplot(data=penguins, x="bill_length_mm", y="body_mass_g",
                     hue="species")
# Modify the labels of the plot
ax.set_xlabel("Bill length (mm)")
ax.set_ylabel("Body mass (g)")
# Set legend position outside of plot
ax.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1,1));
```

If you want to save a plot to file you can use the `plt.savefig` function. Add
the following to the bottom of the cell with the scatterplot code:

```python
plt.savefig("scatterplot.pdf", bbox_inches="tight")
```

The `bbox_inches="tight"` setting ensures that the figure is not clipped when
saved to file.

The Seaborn [website](http://Seaborn.pydata.org/) contains great tutorials and
examples of other ways to plot data!

## Widgets

Since we're typically running our notebooks in a web browser, they are quite
well suited for also including more interactive elements. A typical use case
could be that you want to communicate some results to a collaborator or to
a wider audience, and that you would like them to be able to modify how the
results are displayed. It could, for example, be to select which gene to plot
for, or to see how some parameter value affects a clustering. Jupyter notebooks
has great support for this in the form of *widgets*.

Widgets are eventful Python objects that have a representation in the browser,
often as a control like a slider, text box, etc. These are implemented in the
`ipywidgets` package.

The easiest way to get started with using widgets are via the `interact` and
`interactive` functions. These functions auto-generate widgets from functions
that you define, and then call those functions when you manipulate the widgets.
This might sound abstract so let's look at an example.

Let's take the scatterplot of the penguins dataset that we generated in the
previous section and add widgets that lets us choose variables to plot as well
as coloring of the points.

First we'll import the `interactive` function from `ipywidgets`. Let's also
import the `widgets` module which we we'll use later. Add the following code to
a cell and run it:

```python
from ipywidgets import interactive, widgets
```

Now, in a new cell, define a function called `scatterplot` with the code to
generate the plot itself. Also add a `palette` argument to the function so that
we can specify the colour palette to use for the plot. The function should look
like this:

```python
def scatterplot(x, y, hue, palette):
    ax = sns.scatterplot(data=penguins, x=x, y=y, hue=hue, palette=palette)
```

Run the cell and create a new cell below it.

Next, we'll use the `interactive` function to generate a widget to control the
`x`, `y`, `hue` and `palette` arguments. The `interactive` function takes a
function as its first argument, and then keyword arguments for each of the
arguments in the function. The returned value is a widget which we will store in
a variable called `interactive_scatterplot`. Add the following to a cell and run
it:

```python
interactive_scatterplot = interactive(scatterplot,
            x=["bill_length_mm","bill_depth_mm","flipper_length_mm","body_mass_g"],
            y=["body_mass_g","bill_length_mm","bill_depth_mm","flipper_length_mm"],
            hue=["species","island","sex"],
            palette=["Set1","Set2","Dark2","Paired2"])
```

Importantly, all parameters defined in the `scatterplot` function must be given
in the `interactive` call. The `interactive_scatterplot` widget is now tied to
the `scatterplot` function. However, we still haven't displayed the widget
itself. To do that, simply add `interactive_scatterplot` to a new cell and run it:

```python
interactive_scatterplot
```

This should show the scatterplot with drop-down menus for each of the arguments.
Try changing the `x` and `y` variables to plot by selecting from the respective
drop-downs. The `hue` drop-down now lets you change what variable to use for
colouring the points and the `palette` drop-down changes the colour palette. As
you can see, the available options in the drop-downs are the ones we specified
in the `interactive` call.

Depending on the `type` of the passed argument different types of
widgets will be created by `interactive`. For instance:

- `int` or `float` arguments will generate a slider
- `bool` arguments (True/False) will generate checkbox widgets
- `list` arguments will generate a drop-down
- `str` arguments will generate a text-box

Let's add a slider to control the size of the points. In the Seaborn package
this is controlled by the `s` argument to the `scatterplot` function. Modify the
cell with your `scatterplot` function so it looks like this (remember to run the
cell in order to update the function definition):

```python
def scatterplot(x, y, hue, palette, size=50):
    ax = sns.scatterplot(data=penguins, x=x, y=y, hue=hue, palette=palette, s=size)
```

Note that we added a `size` argument to the function and supplied it to the
Seaborn scatterplot call with `s=size`. Setting `size=50` in the function
definition means that the default size of the points will be 50.

Now we need to add a slider for the `size` argument. Update the cell where we
call the `interactive` function so that it looks like this, then run it:

```python
interactive_scatterplot = interactive(scatterplot,
            x=["bill_length_mm","bill_depth_mm","flipper_length_mm","body_mass_g"],
            y=["body_mass_g","bill_length_mm","bill_depth_mm","flipper_length_mm",],
            hue=["species","island","sex"],
            palette=["Set1","Set2","Dark2","Paired2"],
            size=(20,100,10))
```

Here the `size` argument is defined as a
[tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple) which sets the
minimum value of the slider to 20, the maximum value to 100 and the step size to
10.

Finally, re-run the cell where we displayed the `interactive_scatterplot`
widget. You should now see a slider for the `size` argument (starting at 50).
Try changing the size of the points by moving the slider.

This is how it should look if everything works.

![](images/jupyter_widget.png){ width=700px }

There are lots of widgets, _e.g._:

- Drop-down menus
- Toggle buttons
- Range sliders
- File uploader

... And much, much more. Here is a [list of all available widgets](
https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20List.html)
together with documentation and examples. Some of these widgets cannot be
auto-generated by `interactive`, but fear not! Instead of relying on
auto-generation we can define the widget and supply it directly to `interactive`.

To see this in practice, we'll modify the scatterplot function to display a
title and add a color picker widget that let's us set the color of the title
text.

First, update the scatterplot function so that it looks like this:

```python
def scatterplot(x, y, hue, palette, size, color):
    ax = sns.scatterplot(data=penguins, x=x, y=y, hue=hue, palette=palette, s=size)
    ax.set_title("Penguin scatterplot", color=color)
```

Then run the cell to update the function definition.

Next, we'll define the colour picker widget. Add the definition to the cell
where you defined the `interactive_scatterplot` then supply the widget to the
`interactive` call. The cell should look like this:

```python
colorpicker = widgets.ColorPicker(
    concise=False,
    description='Title color',
    value='blue',
    disabled=False
)
interactive_scatterplot = interactive(scatterplot,
            x=["bill_length_mm","bill_depth_mm","flipper_length_mm","body_mass_g"],
            y=["body_mass_g","bill_length_mm","bill_depth_mm","flipper_length_mm"],
            hue=["species","island","sex"],
            palette=["Set1","Set2","Dark2","Paired2"],
            size=(20, 100, 10),
            color=colorpicker)
```
Run the cell to update the widgets.

Finally, re-run the cell where we displayed the `interactive_scatterplot`. The
plot should now have a title and you should see a new color picker below the
slider for the point size. Try changing the title colour by clicking on the new
color picker.

::: {.callout-caution}
Note that you may have to close the colour picker once you've made your
choice in order to make the plot update.

## Other interactive plots

Jupyter widgets, like we used here, is the most vanilla way of getting
interactive graphs in Jupyter notebooks. Some other alternatives are:

- [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) is a plotting library that uses
  Vega-Lite grammar which is reminiscent of ggplot2 in R. The syntax is
  different from what we've shown here, but it's very powerful once you get the
  hang of it.
- [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/ipython-notebook-tutorial) is actually an
  API to a web service that renders your graph and returns it for display in
  your Jupyter notebook. Generates very visually appealing graphs, but from
  a reproducibility perspective it's maybe not a good idea to be so reliant on
  a third party.
- [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/notebook.html#userguide-notebook)
  is another popular tool for interactive graphs. Most plotting packages for
  Python are built on top of matplotlib, but Bokeh has its own library. This
  can give a steeper learning curve if you're used to the standard packages.
- [mpld3](http://mpld3.github.io) tries to integrate matplotlib with
  Javascript and the D3js package. It doesn't scale well for very large
  datasets, but it's easy to use and works quite seamlessly.

## Extensions

Jupyter Notebook extensions are add-ons that can increase the functionality of
your notebooks. Extensions include themes, editors, git support, renderers and
much more. The most user-friendly way of managing extensions is via the
Extension Manager available in the Jupyter lab interface. You can access it by
clicking the puzzle piece icon in the left sidebar.

::: {.callout-caution}
Note that the extension manager contains a disclaimer warning you that
these third-party extensions are not reviewed for vulnerabilities which
means that you should be careful about what extensions you install.
:::

You can use the search field to perform a free text search for available
extensions, then click 'Install' to install an extension. Not that in some
cases you will be prompted to install additional packages.

While an in-depth listing of available extensions is well beyond the scope
of this tutorial we offer this list of a few extensions that are of particular
relevance to this course:

- [Jupyterlab/GitHub](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-github) -
  view and open files from GitHub
- [Jupyterlab/Git](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git) - version
  controlling with git
- [mamba-org/gator-lab](https://github.com/mamba-org/gator) - manage Conda
  environments
- [voila-dashboards/Jupyterlab-preview](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila) - preview a rendered version of your notebook

:::

## Reproducibility

Now that you have a feeling for what Jupyter can do we'll spend a
little time on things to consider specifically from a repdroducibility point of
view when it comes to Jupyter notebooks.

## Version control of Jupyter notebooks

As we've seen, Jupyter notebooks are plain-text JSON files. This means that they
can be version controlled with Git just like any other text file. However,
because of the way Jupyter notebooks store their content, the diffs produced by
Git can be difficult to interpret. Luckily, there are tools that can provide
content-aware diffs and merge functionality for Jupyter notebooks.

One such tool is [nbdime](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). `nbdime` is
built to understand the structure of Jupyter notebooks and can therefore
generate diffs that are easier to read. It can also be used to merge changes
made to notebooks, which is great especially when collaborating on notebooks
with others.

`nbdime` is already installed in the `jupyter-env` Conda environment you are
using for this tutorial. To try it in action, create a new notebook and name it
`Analysis.ipynb`. Add the following code to the first cell, then run it:

```python
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
penguins = sns.load_dataset("penguins")
```

This simply imports some python modules and loads a dataset.

Save the notebook. Now we'll add and commit the new notebook to the Git repository:

```bash
git add Analysis.ipynb
git commit -m "Add Analysis notebook"
```

So far so good. And nothing new here compared to what we've already learned
about version control. Now let's make some changes to the notebook. First we'll
replace one of the loaded modules. Update the first cell of the notebook so that
it reads:

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
penguins = sns.load_dataset("penguins")
```

Then create a new cell where we'll calculate the mean of each numeric value
grouped by species. In the new cell, add the following code:

```python
penguins.groupby("species").mean(numeric_only=True)
```

Run the cell and save the notebook.

Now use `git diff` to view the changes we've made to the notebook. Run:

```bash
git diff Analysis.ipynb
```

Even with very minor modifications to the notebook the diff will contain
numerous lines that are difficult to interpret. This is because the notebook not
only contains the code, but also cell metadata and output (in this case a
table produced by the second cell).

Now let's generate a more easy-to-read diff. Run:

```bash
nbdiff -s Analysis.ipynb
```

This will use the `nbdiff` tool that comes with `nbdime` to show an inline diff
of the notebook. The `-s` flag tells `nbdiff` to only show differences for the
actual code changes, ignoring changes in metadata and output. There are a number
of flags you can use here to customise the diff. The uppercase version of each
flag will ignore the respective change type. For example, to see the diff but
ignore changes to the output of cells you can run:

```bash
nbdiff -O Analysis.ipynb
```

nbdime also comes with a graphical web-based diff viewer. To try it, run:

```bash
nbdiff-web Analysis.ipynb
```

This will open up a tab in your web browser showing you changes made to the
notebook side-by-side for each cell, including also cell output. This makes it
easy to see changes made both to code and outputs such as tables and plots.

### Other tools for version control of notebooks

- You can also install the nbdime jupyter [lab
  extension](https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime) to get access to the diff
  functionality directly from the Jupyter lab interface. If you also install the
  [jupyterlab-git](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git) extension you
  can both view diffs and commit changes directly from Jupyter lab.
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) actually comes with built-in support
  for both Jupyter notebooks and Git so that you can view [informative
  diffs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_custom-notebook-diffing)
  directly from the editor

## Making sure notebooks work as expected

One of the great things with Jupyter notebooks is the ability to do data
exploration in an interactive way. Because loaded data, defined variables and
functions remain in the notebook until you restart the kernel, you can easily
make changes to your analysis and re-run cells to see the effect of the changes
immediately. However, this can also be a source of errors and inconsistencies if
you, during your work, modify or use variables in cells upstream of their
initial definition.

The `nbval` package can help you catch these types of errors. `nbval` is a
plugin for the `pytest` testing framework that can be used to test Jupyter
notebooks. It works by executing each cell in the notebook and comparing the
output to the output stored in the notebook. If the output is the same, the test
passes. If the output differs, the test fails. `nbval` is also pre-installed in
the `jupyter-env` Conda environment you're using for this tutorial.

As an example, we'll keep working with the `Analysis.ipynb` notebook we've
created.

Let's say we want to estimate the size of the bill of penguins using the
`bill_length_mm` and `bill_depth_mm` columns. We'll do this by adding a new cell
to our notebook with the following code:

```python
penguins["bill_size"] = (penguins["bill_length_mm"] * penguins["bill_depth_mm"])
```

Run the cell and add a new one below it. In the new cell, output the mean of
each column grouped by `island` using the following code:

```python
penguins.groupby("island").mean(numeric_only=True)
```

Run the cell to see the output. Looks good. Now we have a very simple example of
some exploratory analyses on a dataset.

Save the notebook and try running `nbval` on it to see if it works as
expected. From the commandline, run:

```bash
pytest --nbval Analysis.ipynb
```

nbval tests each cell in your notebook by executing it and comparing the output
to the output stored in the notebook. If the output is the same, the test
passes. The output of the test should look something like this:

```
collected 4 items

Analysis.ipynb ....                                                                                                   [100%]

========== 4 passed in 1.93s ==========
```

Now let's say we realize that we want to normalize the `bill_size` values by the
body mass of the penguins. We'll just modify the cell where we calculated this
value, introducing a small piece of code to divide by the `body_mass_g` column.

Change the third cell of the notebook so that it reads:

```python
penguins["bill_size"] = (penguins["bill_length_mm"] * penguins["bill_depth_mm"]) / penguins["body_mass_g"]
sns.scatterplot(data=penguins, x="bill_size", y="flipper_length_mm", hue="island")
```

Re-run the cell and save the notebook. So far so good! Let's test the notebook
again with nbval. Just like before run it from the commandline with:

```bash
pytest --nbval Analysis.ipynb
```

If you've followed the instructions, this second run of nbval should generate a
`FAILED` test, showing something like:

```
==================== short test summary info ====================
FAILED Analysis.ipynb::Cell 3
================== 1 failed, 3 passed in 1.83s ==================
```

What happened here was that we modified the cell where we calculated the
`bill_size` value, but we didn't re-run the cell where we output the mean of
each column grouped by `island`. This means that the output of the last cell in
the notebook now differs from what is actually stored in the notebook variables.
This type of error can be difficult to spot, especially if you have a large
notebook with many cells. Luckily, nbval can help us here.

::: {.callout-note}
Note that nbval reports cell numbers using 0-based numbering, so when the test
fails on `Cell 3` it actually refers to the 4th cell in the notebook.
:::

This problem could have been solved if we had re-run the cell where we output
the mean of each column grouped by `island`. In fact, it is good practice to
re-run all cells in a notebook before saving it. If you in addition restart the
kernel before re-running you make sure that you haven't introduced any 'hidden states'

::: {.callout-tip title="Ignoring specific cells"}
One caveat of `nbval` is that it doesn't work well with cells that generate
plots. You can tell `nbval` to ignore the output of specific cells by adding
`# NBVAL_IGNORE_OUTPUT` to the top of a cell.

## Converting notebooks

Notebooks can be converted to various output formats such as HTML, PDF, LaTeX
*etc.* directly from the **File** -> **Save and Export Notebook As...** menu.

Conversion can also be performed on the command line using the `jupyter nbconvert`
command. `nbconvert` is installed together with the `jupyter` Conda
package and is executed on the command line by running `jupyter nbconvert`.

The syntax for converting a Jupyter notebook is:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to <FORMAT> notebook.ipynb
```

Here `<FORMAT>` can be any of `asciidoc`, `custom`, `html`, `latex`, `markdown`,
`notebook`, `pdf`, `python`, `rst`, `script`, `slides`. Converting to some
output formats (_e.g._ PDF) may require you to install separate software such
as [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) or a **TeX** environment.

Try converting the `jupyter-tutorial.ipynb` notebook that you have been working
on for this tutorial to HTML using `jupyter nbconvert`.

::: {.callout-tip}
If the plots in HTML rendered version of your notebook are not displayed
properly, try changing the `matplotlib_inline.backend_inline.set_matplotlib_formats('pdf', 'svg')`
line to `matplotlib_inline.backend_inline.set_matplotlib_formats('retina')`.
:::

`nbconvert` can also be used to run a Jupyter notebook from the command line
by running:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --execute --to <FORMAT> notebook.ipynb
```

`nbconvert` executes the cells in a notebook, captures the output and saves the
results in a new file. Try running it on the `jupyter-tutorial.ipynb` notebook.

You can also specify a different output file with `--output <filename>`.

So in order to execute your `jupyter-tutorial.ipynb` notebook and save it to a file
named `report.html` you could run:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to html --output report.html --execute jupyter-tutorial.ipynb
```

## Notebooks and Quarto

You may have noticed that a lot of the functionality in Jupyter is overlapping
with Quarto. And you may be wondering which one to use. This is a difficult
question to answer as it will depend on your use-case and personal preference.
As such, any answer will be subjective, but we'll try to give you some
pointers on how to get the best out of both worlds.

While similar in some ways Jupyter and Quarto are not completely overlapping.
Quarto is great for generating high-quality reports and manuscripts, and is
agnostic to the programming language used. Jupyter on the other hand is
great for interactive data analysis and exploration with a more direct
connection between code and output. While Jupyter is also somewhat agnostic to
programming language, it is most commonly used with Python and with both the
Jupyter and Python ecosystem at its back it can be customized with a lot of
different extensions and plugins.

The good news is that the two can be used together allowing you to get the best
of both. For example, you may like the professional look of rendered Quarto
documents but really like the interactive and exploratory nature of Jupyter.
Well you can simply work as you normally do in Jupyter and then use Quarto to
render the notebook to a high-quality report or manuscript.

To give you an example, take a look at the `supplementary_material.ipynb` file
in the `jupyter/` tutorial directory. Open this notebook in the Jupyter lab
interface (make sure you have activated the `jupyter-env` Conda environment).

As you can see this notebook contains some brief descriptions in Markdown and
code to generate a few plots. It uses the output from the MRSA case-study
Snakemake workflow you worked on in the Snakemake tutorial. This is a common
use-case for Jupyter notebooks; to generate summary statistics and plots from
the results of a workflow run. (A real-world example could of course include a
lot more in-depth exploratory analyses).

Now, let's say you want to share the results of this notebook with your PI or
collaborators. We could simply share the notebook file, or as we saw in the
previous section, convert it to HTML or PDF via `jupybter nbconvert`.

Let's do that first so we have something to compare with. Run the following:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to HTML --output supplementary_material.nbconvert.html supplementary_material.ipynb
```

Open the `supplementary_material.nbconvert.html` file in a browser to see that
it looks like you expect. This looks more or less like the original notebook.

Now let's go one step further and render the notebook to a high-quality report
using Quarto. We can actually add a YAML header to the notebook with some
document options that Quarto understands. Create a new cell in the notebook
(from the Jupyter lab interface) and move it to the top. In this cell, add the
following:

```yaml
---
title: Supplementary material
subtitle: Supplementary tables and plots for the MRSA study
format:
    html:
        embed-resources: true
        code-fold: true
        code-tools: true
language:
  code-summary: Click to show code
bibliography: references.bib
---
```

Set the cell type to `Markdown`, then run the cell. Most likely that cell will
look rather weird but that's OK. We'll fix that in a bit.

Save the notebook and now render the document with Quarto from the commandline:

```bash
quarto render supplementary_material.ipynb
```

Open up the `supplementary_material.html` file in a browser and compare it to
the `supplementary_material.nbconvert.html` file. You should see that the
Quarto version looks a lot better. The fact that Quarto supports rendering of
Jupyter notebooks means you can keep editing your notebooks as you normally
would and use Quarto for rendering the final document. Also there's very little
we had to change in the notebook to make it work with Quarto. If you look
closely at the code cells used to generate the plots and table you'll see that
they contain code-chunk options in the same form we used in the Quarto tutorial.
These options do not impact the notebook when run in Jupyter, making it easy to
use the two tools in combination.

Let's go back to the YAML header cell and fix how it looks in the Jupyter
notebook. The reason it looks weird is that Jupyter doesn't understand the
syntax. But luckily there's a Jupyter lab Quarto extension you can install to
fix this. Click the extension icon in the left sidebar and search for `quarto`.
Install the `jupyterlab-quarto` extension and then reload the page. Now the YAML
header should look a lot better.

Try adding more options to the header to customize the look of the rendered
document. For instance you could:

- add a Table of contents with (`toc: true`)
- try out different [themes](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html)
- add your name as author (`author: Your Name`)
- add a date (`date: last-modified`)

and much more.

## Extra material

The following material contains some additional tips and tricks on how to use
Jupyter notebooks. This is not part of the core of the Jupyter material and you
can choose what you want to go through, or skip it entirely.

Here are some useful resources if you want to read more about Jupyter in
general:

- The [Jupyter project site](http://jupyter.org) contains a lot of information
  and inspiration.
- The [Jupyter Notebook documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
- A [guide](http://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to using
  widgets for creating interactive notebooks.

## Running Jupyter notebooks on a cluster

- Login to Uppmax, making sure to use a specific login node, _e.g._ `rackham1`:

```
ssh <your-user-name>@rackham1.uppmax.uu.se
```

- Create/activate a Conda environment containing `jupyter`, _e.g._:

```
conda create -n jupyter -c conda-forge jupyter
```

- activate the environment, then run:

```
jupyter notebook --no-browser
```

When the Jupyter server starts up you should see something resembling:

```
[I 2023-11-13 22:15:36.944 ServerApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: <path-to-your-directory>
[I 2023-11-13 22:15:36.944 ServerApp] Jupyter Server 2.10.0 is running at:
[I 2023-11-13 22:15:36.944 ServerApp] http://localhost:8888/tree?token=25fa07e89b7c0bc2e518f259ba79c67847ca813cdf4eeed6
[I 2023-11-13 22:15:36.944 ServerApp]     http://127.0.0.1:8888/tree?token=25fa07e89b7c0bc2e518f259ba79c67847ca813cdf4eeed6
[I 2023-11-13 22:15:36.944 ServerApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
```

Now a Jupyter notebook server is running on the Uppmax end. The line that says:

```
[I 2023-11-13 22:15:36.944 ServerApp] http://localhost:8888/tree?token=25fa07e89b7c0bc2e518f259ba79c67847ca813cdf4eeed6
```

Contains information on the port used on the server side (8888 in this case) and
the token required to use the server (`25fa07e89b7c0bc2e518f259ba79c67847ca813cdf4eeed6`).

Next step is to use this information to login to the server from your local
computer.

**On your local computer**

In a terminal, run the following command to start port forwarding of
port 8080 on your local computer to the remote port on the Uppmax side. Replace
<remote-port> with the port given when you started the server on Uppmax. Also
replace <your-user-name> with your user name on Uppmax.

```bash
ssh -N -L localhost:8080:localhost:<remote-port> <your-user-name>@rackham1.uppmax.uu.se
```

As long as this process is running the port forwarding is running. To disable it
simply interrupt it with `CTRL + C`.

Connect to the Jupyter server by opening `localhost:8080` in your browser. When
prompted, paste the token you got when starting the server on Uppmax and set a
new password.

## Using Binder to share interactive notebooks

[Binder](https://mybinder.org/) is a service that allows you to share Jupyter
notebooks with others, while also allowing them to run the notebooks in the
browser. This is great if you wish to share an analysis and have others interact
with the code and results, without them having to install anything locally. What
you will need is:

1. A public GitHub repository containing the notebooks you want to share.
2. An `environment.yml` file in the repository containing the Conda environment
   required to run the notebooks.
3. Data files (if any) required to run the notebook(s).

Binder will then create a Docker image containing the Conda environment and the
notebooks, and run a Jupyter server on this image. The Docker image is then
hosted on the Binder server and can be used by anyone with the link to the
repository to run the notebooks interactively in their browser.

To show you an example we've created a basic [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/NBISweden/workshop-reproducible-research-binder_example)
containing the `supplementary_material.ipynb` notebook from the previous
section. If you go to the repository you will see a badge saying "launch
binder", click this to start the Binder server. This will take a few minutes the
first time you do it, but after that it should be faster. When the server is
ready you will be presented with the now familiar Jupyter interface. Go ahead
and open up the `supplementary_material.ipynb` notebook and run it.

You can now interact with the notebook as you would if you had it running on a
local Jupyter server. You can change the code, run it, and see the results. You
can also add new cells and write new code. However, you cannot save the changes
you make to the notebook.

To read more about Binder and how to use it, see the
[Binder documentation](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). For pointers
on how to make data available to the notebooks you share via Binder, see this
guide on
[Accessing data in your Binder](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/binder/zero-to-binder.html#accessing-data-in-your-binder).
